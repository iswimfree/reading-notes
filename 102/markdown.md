# i try not to get "ahead" of myself when making a header

+ You can make a header a few different sizes but lets stick with the basic 3. 
  1 # is the largest ## will decrese the size and lastly ### will decrease the size to the smallest availible.
+ when using # to make a header always place a space after it so it emboldens.

## lists just go on, and on, and on.....

* you can make different kinds of lists with markdown.
ordered and unordered so wether you want to rank things or just list them out the power is all yours. for example everyday at 7pm i have 3 alarms that go off
1. Take my insulin
2. Eat dinner
3. Brush my teeth
 
or a list with no major importance aka and unordered list 
 + Cheese 
 + Carrots
 + Cabbage
 things that all start with the letter C

### I really cant believe he said that... wow
