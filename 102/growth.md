# What is growth mindset?
>A challenge only becomes an obstacle when you bow to it. – Ray Davis

+ Growth Mindset to me is a mindset based on potential not the limitations that we geneically have. although we may have some set limits on what we can learn there keeping a growth mindset allow us to maximize our minds. By finding new ways of critical thinking and new solutions to old problems. To me growth mindset is about remaining positive in the face of failure and trying again.

## Ways to remind myself to stay in a growth mindset
+ Always believe in my abilty to achieve.
+ remain positive in the face of failure.
+ have fun with everything that i do, because an excited brain is an active brain.
