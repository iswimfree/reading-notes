## HTML: whats i've learned 

+ HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, it helps provide structure and order for the other layers.

+ Identify target audience
1. Who are they?
2. What are they into 
3. their age
4. what platform are they on, Mobile, desktop, laptop ect..

+ There are 3 Major parts Header, Main, and Footer.

+ most tags have an "opening < and a closing >"

+ Always make a Wire frame first: a drawn or didgitally created structure of what youd like the page to look like.
