# Forms and JS Events


## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
- this chapter is about forms and how to use them, it starts off with info about how to fill in forms by typing in them
- A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.
- If the form control allows the user to enter text, then the value of the form control is whatever the user has typed in.
- Form controls live inside a < form> 
- very < form> element requires an action attribute.
- When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a single- line text input.

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
- Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-style- position property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.
-The marker sits to the left of the block of text. (This is the default behaviour if this property is not used.)
- As with several of the other CSS properties, there is a property that acts as a shorthand for list styles. It is called list-style,
- you can use all table functions 
- utting all table headings in bold (the default style for the < th> element) makes them easier to read.
-  If you have empty cells in your table, then you can use the empty-cells property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.
-The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells. By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then
the border-spacing property allows you to control the gap.
