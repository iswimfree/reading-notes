# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Chapter 3: Lists (pp.62-73)

- The ordered list is created with the < ol> element.
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li>
- The unordered list is created with the < ul> element.
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li>
- The definition list is created with the < dl>
- This is used to contain the term being defined< dt>
- use the < dd> to contacin the definition 
- You can put a second list inside an < li> element to create a sub- list or nested list.

## Chapter 13:Boxes (pp.300-329)

- boxes default size is just enough to hold content 
- best way to size bozes is using pixels or px 
- you can use min or max height to size boxes to your preset limits 
- hidden: This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
- scroll: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
- Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
- Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
- Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
- If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
  
## Java Review:

- A Boolean variable can only have avalue of true or fa1se, but this data type is very helpful.
- First, Booleans are used when the value can only be true/ fa1se. You could also think of these values as on/off or 0/1: true is equivalent to on or 1, fa1se is equivalent to off or 0
- Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the same script.
- The name of a variable must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
- the name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name
- You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.
- && mean "and" || mean "or" ! means "not"
- if check a condition if found true it will execute code assigned 
- if else executes code set on on conditions outside the previous if
