## A little About me

Hi my name is Michael Russell, but you can call me Mikey.
I am a software developer specializing in visual and structural design.I am pretty easy going and expert in “out of the box” thinking.
I have an extensive background in sales, team building, and communication technology. I have a wide array of hobbies: Reading, Writing, gaming, singing, and most importantly being a husband and a father.
When the pandemic hit everything changed, i realized i need to find a new path that would allow me to lead a better life so i chose coding.
Here is my journey , all of my notes and thoughts.
