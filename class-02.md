## what ive learned: HTML & CSS

## chapter 2: Text (pp.40-61)
- HTML has six "levels" of headings, Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. 
- By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line
- By enclosing words in the tags < b> and < /b> we can make characters appear bold. < i> will make them italic.
- When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space.
- if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag < br/> To create a break between themes < hr />
-  < strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance.
-  If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the < abbr>
The < blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph
## Chapter 10: Intro CSS (pp.226-245)

- Block level elements look like they start on a new line.
- inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new
- Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.
- Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value,
- You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a < style>
- If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence. 
- ## Javascrpit

- Its always best to keep JS code in its own file and foled with a.js extension
- js always activates where its called in html 
- a script is a series of instructions a computer follows one by one 
- js is case sensitive 
- you should always write comments to explain what your code does or what you are trying to acheieve
