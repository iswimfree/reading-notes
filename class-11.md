## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
- First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name.
- Where the < img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute.
- In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.
- The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image
- New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.
- By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block- level element using the display property with a value of block.
- The background-image property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
- page 414 has a lot of info on how to adj the background image please take note of this page *
  
## Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)

- Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
- List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.
- Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.
- There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as: adwords.google.co.uk/
- it is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of
the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites out there that have already been optimized for a given keyword, the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on that term.
- As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.
- In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting.
- Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.
- To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.
