## Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)

- A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
- As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. 
- To add an image into the page you need to use an < img>
- This tells the browser where it can find the image file SRC
- alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
- You can also use the title attribute with the < img> element to provide additional information about the image.
- width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
-heigh: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

## Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
