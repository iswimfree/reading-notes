> "This was **a lot** of reading"- Mikey, A Codefellows Student.

## A Brief Summary of What I’ve learned:

### Introduction (pp.2-11)

- Understanding HTML and CSS can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate effectively
- People access websites using software called a web browser.
- When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
- Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.
- HTML is teh skeleton of a website where as CSS is what adds the colors dynamics
- In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

- HTML Describes the structure of a web page
- the skelton should look like
- < html>
- < body> this is the body tag
- < h1> main heading< /h1>
- < p> you can put any kind of words here just like these ones lol< p>
- < h2>a sub header tag< h2>
- < /body>
< /Html>"

- <> these angle brackets used in html The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose.
- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value,
### HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)

-Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
- < !-- you can make a comment to you code with this -- > 
- Its a good idea to add comments because it makes it easier to figure what you were doing previously and if other people try to work on your code
- Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page
- The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.
- Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
- Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
- Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
### HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)
- web page authors used < div> elements to group together related elements on the page
